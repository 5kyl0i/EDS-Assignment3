## Assignment 3: Web Scraping

For this assignment, you are required to scrape data from e-commerce websites such as [Lelong](http://www.lelong.com.my), [Lazada](http://www.lazada.com.my/), [Mudah](http://www.mudah.my/), [iProperty](https://www.iproperty.com.my/), [Booking](http://www.booking.com), [Expedia](https://www.expedia.com.my/) etc.

You are required to fork this Jupyter Notebook from my Github [here](https://github.com/kuanhoong/EDS-Assignment3 ) and then scrape the latest 200 items from one of the website mentioned above. The data should include:

* Product Name/Product Title
* Amount/Price
* Brand
* Comments/Reviews
* Number of views

In addition, you are required to export the scraped data to the data frame. Upon successful extracting data to data frame, you are required to do a data analysis on the data. 

Your analysis should provide answers to the following questions:
* What do you think is interesting about this data? Tell a story about some interesting thing you have discovered by looking at the data.
* Visualize your data with matplotlib as well as with folium library package.

For example, you might consider whether there is a difference in pricings at different times doing the day or city, or whether other factors influnced the pricings etc. Another thing you might consider is whether there is a relationship between the pricing and number of reviews or comments. Show your analysis workflow in your Jupyter notebook. The final submission should be pushed back to respective Github account.
